# SiegfriedBot
A Discord.js bot made to solve problems off-screen for my GBF crew. Right now his main function is sending out pings for all the possible raids in GBF, smartly.

TODO:
- Server-specific ping lists (in case one instance of Siegfried is used in multiple servers)
- The "auto-pitmaster" for GC's guild war needs
- Let people praise Siegfried for his hard work
- Allow aliases for raid categories and elements
- Sort raid lists within the bot's database?
- Log errors to a file

Bugs under watch:
- First user in a list being removed from ping list after a different user unsubscribed (seems to be fixed, but under watch nonetheless)

Additional features in consideration:
- Event calendar
- Reminders based on event calendar
- Spark tracker
- Time in JST
- GBF.wiki page grabber
- Custom stickers/emoji
