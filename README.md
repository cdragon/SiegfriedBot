# SiegfriedBot
A Discord.js bot made to solve problems off-screen for my GBF crew. Right now his main function is sending out pings for all the possible raids in GBF, smartly.

TODO:
- Server-specific ping lists (in case one instance of Siegfried is used in multiple servers)

Additional features in consideration:
- Event calendar
- Reminders based on event calendar
- Spark tracker
- Time in JST
- GBF.wiki page grabber
- Custom stickers/emoji
